## How to view comments on videos

To view comments on a video, just scroll down the video's page. Replies are threaded to make it easy to follow conversations. All comments on YouTube are public and anyone can reply to a comment that you post.

If you can't find a comment after you receive a notification, it is possible that the comment has already been removed. Comments can be removed by the person who posted them, the channel owner or for policy violations.

## How to delete comments

1. Go to Comment History.
2. Next to the comment, click or tap More .
3. Select Edit or Delete.
