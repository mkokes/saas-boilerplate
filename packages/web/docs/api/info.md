We are currently evaluating our API in a closed beta phase and are looking for partners for feedback and testing. If you are interested please [get in touch with us](mailto:info@amgaventures.com?subject=API).

## What is an API? Do I need it to get started?

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, youâ€™re using an API.

No, you don't need to know about this to start using our service, this is just for developers.
