We released beta [support for Rust][release-post] back in March. Today,
we're blessing it with full release status. ðŸŽ‰

Dependabot is now running on over 100 Rust repos and has created over 1,000 pull
requests. It supports Rust workspaces, and as of today it can update Rust
dependencies that specify a git source (public or private), as well as those
coming from crates.io.

Given the above, we're excited to give Dependabot's Rust support full
release status. We'll keep improving it, and we always value
[your feedback][feedback-link], but it's ready for you to rely on right now.

Enjoy!
