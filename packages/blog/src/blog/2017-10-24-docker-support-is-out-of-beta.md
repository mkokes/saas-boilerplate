We released beta [support for Dockerfiles][release-post] two weeks ago. Today,
we're blessing it with full release status. ðŸŽ‰

We're always improving Dependabot across all our languages, but now that
it can handle Dockerfiles that specify a digest and/or use a private registry
we think it's ready for you to rely on. Enjoy!
