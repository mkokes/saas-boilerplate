GitHub announced the [GitHub Security Advisory API][github-announcement] today
at GitHub Universe. Dependabot now uses it to pull in additional security
vulnerability details, and to respond to new security advisories instantly.

</p>

Dependabot has been using GitHub's vulnerability alerts database as a source
since [July][github-security-alerts-original], but the new Security Alerts API
gives us more data and makes the information available to us in real time.
That means you can now expect a Dependabot PR to fix any security
vulnerabilities seconds after they're published to GitHub's database.

We've got more security news coming soon - stay tuned, and stay safe out there!
