We released beta [support for Python][release-post] back in July. Today, we're
blessing it with full release status. üéâ

Since our beta for Python began we've had over 500 pull requests merged, added
support for alternative `requirements.txt` names, and added support for range
requirements. We've also added support for updating a project's `setup.py`.

We're always improving Dependabot across all our languages, given the above we
think our Python support is ready for you to rely on.

Next up, we'll be working on [adding support for Pipenv][pipenv-support].
