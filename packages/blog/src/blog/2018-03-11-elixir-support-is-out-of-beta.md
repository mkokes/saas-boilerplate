We released beta [support for Elixir][release-post] back in January. Today,
we're blessing it with full release status. 🎉

Dependabot is now running on over 60 Elixir repos and has created over 500 PRs.
It supports Elixir umbrella applications, and as of today it can update Elixir
dependencies that specify a git source, as well as those coming from the main
hex registry.

Given the above, it's time for us to give Dependabot's Elixir support full
release status. We'll keep improving it, and we always value
[your feedback][feedback-link], but it's ready for you to rely on right now.

Enjoy!

🍸

PS. We couldn't have got here without the help [Steve Domin][steve] has given
us. Thanks Steve!
