Using Git submodules in your project? Dependabot can now keep them up-to-date
for you.

To get started, just click the "Add project" button and select the repo
you'd like to automate updates for. Select "Git Submodules" from the list of
languages, and click "Add". Dependabot will check for updates for you
every day, and create pull requests when it finds any.

We added submodule support after a [request from customer][feedback-request].
If there's a feature you'd like us to add, or if you ever have any feedback on
Dependabot, [let us know][feedback-link]!
