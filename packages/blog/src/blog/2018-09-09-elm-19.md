Dependabot can now update your `elm.json` if you're using Elm 0.19, and will
continue to update your `elm-package.json` if you're using Elm 0.18.

We'll be working on ironing out any bugs over the next few weeks, but
Dependabot's Elm support should be feature complete right now.

Give it a try and [let us know][feedback-link] if you have any feedback!
