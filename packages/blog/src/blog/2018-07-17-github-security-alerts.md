We've integrated Dependabot with GitHub's Security Alerts. Now when you receive
a security alert from GitHub you can expect a PR from Dependabot that fixes it
soon after.

Dependabot has [automatically responded to security advisories][automatically-respond-to-security-advisories]
since April, when we integrated with sources for Ruby, Rust and PHP
vulnerability alerts. Since then we've also added a JS source, and created an
Elixir one.

Integrating with GitHub's Security Alerts gives us another great data source
that is [expanding fast][github-python-advisories] and has a
[fantastic team behind it][appcanary-acquired]. We owe a huge debt of thanks to
GitHub for making the data available - it's another significant contribution
to the open source community from a company that already does so much.

Stay safe out there!
