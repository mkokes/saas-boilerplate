Dependabot now checks custom Maven repositories specified in your `pom.xml` for
updates. You'll start seeing updates for dependencies from them automatically.

If you use a `settings.xml` file to specify your repositories and would like
Dependabot to be able to update those dependencies, too, ~~please
[get in touch][get-in-touch]~~. **Update:** You can now enter credentials for
private Maven registries in your Dependabot dashboard.

Oh, and Dependabot now [supports multimodule Maven projects][multimodule-projects]
too.
