Using npm for your JavaScript dependencies? Dependabot can now help you keep
your `package-lock.json` up-to-date.

(Using Yarn instead? No problem - we've been supporting Yarn since May!)

To get started, just click the "Add project" button and select the repo
you'd like to automate updates for. Select "JavaScript (npm, beta)" from the
list of languages, and click "Add".

If you use npm we'd love to hear from you as we beta test support for it. If you
have any suggestions, or if you experience any issues, please don't hesitate to
[let us know][feedback-link]!
