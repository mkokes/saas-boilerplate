Python devs: Dependabot can now help keep your `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`
up-to-date. üéâ

We've been excited about Pipenv since Kenneth Reitz launched it, and are really
pleased to see it become an
[officially recommended tool][pipenv-official-tweet] on Python.org. We think it
can make dependency management in Python easier than in any other language.

Given the above it's about time Dependabot supported Pipenv, so starting today
it does. As with all our betas we'll be improving support rapidly based on your
[feedback][feedback], but we're confident our Pipenv support already works well.

Want to give it a try? Just select "Python (Pipfile beta)" as the language when
adding your project to Dependabot.
