We released beta [support for npm][release-post] a month ago. Today,
we're blessing it with full release status. 🎉

We're always improving Dependabot across all our languages, but now that
we've created over 1,000 npm pull requests we think Dependabot's npm support is
ready for you to rely on.

We're also excited to announce that Dependabot can now bump your private
JavaScript packages, whether you're using npm or Yarn.

Enjoy!
