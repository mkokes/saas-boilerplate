Dependabot now signs its commits, so you can be sure they're from us.

<p class="image-medium">
  <img alt="Signed commit" style="max-width: 700px;" src="images/signed-commit.png">
</p>

We're thankful to the good people at GitHub for making this feature available
through the API when we requested it.

✌️
